Furthermore, a counterfactual modification should itself represent a valid image in the context of the underlying task to be meaningful. The modification of a handwritten digit should result in something that still looks like a digit, and\u2014crucially\u2014not a random noise pattern. Due to these constraints, these domains have to use more sophisticated methods to solve the non-trivial optimization problem of finding counterfactual samples. In image generation, for instance one possible approach would be to use gradient descent to iteratively modify the original image using a joint objective function that combines the distance to the original image and the difference in model prediction.</p> <p>In natural language processing, the space of possible modifications is at least discrete, but still very large since there is an extremely large number of words which could be inserted, removed or replaced at any position in a given text.</p>"},{"location":"get_started_core/#graph-counterfactuals","title":"Graph Counterfactuals","text":"<p>In contrast to these previously mentioned domains, graph data structures are much easier to handle. For one thing, graphs are discrete structures for which nodes and edges can either exist or not exist. Additionally, the vocabulary of different node and edge types is usually much smaller than with natural language, for instance.</p> <p>Therefore, one possible approach to generate counterfactuals\u2014infeasible in other domains\u2014is to generate all possible modifications of the original element, obtain the model's prediction for each of these modifications and then filter the modifications that lead to the largest deviation in the model's prediction. This is the basic approach taken by the <code>vgd_counterfactuals</code> library.</p>"},{"location":"get_started_core/#graph-domains","title":"\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Graph Domains","text":"<p>One important consideration for the generation of counterfactuals as described in the previous paragraph is that not all graphs are the same. The rules of what constitutes a valid graph structure\u2014and what modifications are allowed\u2014depend on the domain of where the graph originates from.</p> <p>For example, a molecular graph is a specific type of graph where nodes represent atoms and edges represent chemical bonds. In this case, there are very specific rules about which kinds of connections between atoms are allowed to constitute a valid molecule. Such a molecular graph needs completely different rules than an electrical circuit graph, where nodes represents connections and edges represent electrical components.</p> <p>Ultimately, the \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f graph domain heavily influences how counterfactuals need to be generated, which is why they are a core concept of the <code>vgd_counterfactuals</code> library. Currently, the following domains are supported:</p> <ul> <li>Simple Color Graphs: For testing and demonstration purposes, where nodes are colored and edges connect nodes of different colors.</li> <li>Molecular Graphs: Using RDKit and SMILES notation, where nodes represent atoms and edges represent chemical bonds.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"get_started_core/#domain-representation","title":"\ud83d\udcdd Domain Representation","text":"<p>The <code>vgd_counterfactuals</code> library builds on top of the Visual Graph Datasets (VGD) library for it's graph representation. Consequently, it borrows the VGD concept of the \ud83d\udcdd domain representation. In the VGD library, each graph can be represented either generically as a graph structure with numeric node and edge features (ideal for machine learning applications) or in a domain-specific string format.</p> <p>An example of such a domain-specific string representation is the SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notation for molecular graphs, which is a widely used format to represent chemical structures as strings. The caffeine molecule, for example, can be represented as the SMILES string <code>CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C(=O)N2C)C</code>. This format is very compact and allows for easy sharing and storage of molecular graphs. More importantly, this exchange format is the foundation for many domain-specific tools such as the cheminformatics toolkit RDKit.</p>"},{"location":"get_started_core/#modularization","title":"\ud83e\udde9 Modularization","text":"<p>The goal of the <code>vgd_counterfactuals</code> library is to be customizable and to provide a modular framework for counterfactual generation. This means that individual components such as the model, the neighborhood function etc. can be swapped out and/or be replaced with custom implementations.</p> <p>The library is designed around the following core components which can be assembled to interact with each other:</p> <ul> <li>Neighborhood Function. Given the \ud83d\udcdd domain representation of a graph structure, this function should return the domain representations of it's immediate neighbors\u2014meaning all valid graphs with an edit distance of 1. The neighborhood function is domain-specific and will have to be implemented or customized for each new graph domain.</li> <li>Counterfactual Distance Function. Given an original graph and a modified graph, as well as the corresponding model predictions, this function is meant to return a numeric value that represents a measure of how different the two predictions are. This function will have to be supplied by the user as it depends on the specific circumstances. For instance, different distance functions will be necessary for regression tasks than for classification tasks. Another important consideration is that sometimes only one direction of the distance matters, e.g. increasing/decreasing the value in a regression task.</li> <li>Predictor Model. In principle, the library is meant to be agnostic to the specific model implementation, meaning that it should be possible to generate counterfactuals based on any model. However, to make a given model work with the library, one needs to supply an adapter function which accepts the domain representation of a graph, queries the model and returns the model's prediction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"get_started_example/","title":"Introduction by Example","text":"<p>This section will provide a simple mock example of how to use the VGD Counterfactuals library to generate counterfactuals for a given graph representation.</p> Basic Example<pre><code>import tempfile\n\nfrom visual_graph_datasets.processing.molecules import MoleculeProcessing\n\nfrom vgd_counterfactuals.base import CounterfactualGenerator\nfrom vgd_counterfactuals.testing import MockModel\nfrom vgd_counterfactuals.generate.molecules import get_neighborhood\n\nprocessing = MoleculeProcessing() \nmodel = MockModel()\n\ngenerator = CounterfactualGenerator(\n    processing=processing,  # (1)\n    model=model,  # (2)\n    neighborhood_func=get_neighborhood,  # (3)\n    distance_func=lambda orig, mod: abs(orig - mod),  # (4)\n    predict_func=lambda model, graphs: model.predict_graphs(graphs),  # (5) \n)\n\nwith tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as path: # (6)\n\n    # The \"generate\" function will create all the possible neighbors of the\n    # given \"original\" element, then query the model for to predict the\n    # output for each of them, and sort them by their distance to the original.\n    # The top k elements will be turned into a temporary visual graph dataset\n    # within the given folder \"path\".\n    index_data_map = generator.generate(\n        original='CCCCCC',\n        # Path to the folder into which to save the vgd element files\n        path=path,\n        # The number of counterfactuals to be returned.\n        # Elements will be sorted by their distance.\n        k_results=10,\n    )\n\n    # The keys of the resulting dict are the integer indices and the values\n    # are dicts themselves which describe the corresponding vgd elements.\n    # These dicts contain for example the absolute path to the PNG file,\n    # the full graph representation and additional metadata.\n    print(f'generated {len(index_data_map)} counterfactuals:')\n    for index, data in index_data_map.items():\n        print(f' * {data[\"metadata\"][\"name\"]} '\n              f' - distance: {data[\"metadata\"][\"distance\"]:.2f}')\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>The domain specific <code>Processing</code> instance from the VGD libarary which implements the conversion     of the string domain representation into the graph dictionary format.

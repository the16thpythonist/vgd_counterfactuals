class CounterfactualGenerator:
    """
    Generic implementation for the generation of counterfactuals.

    An instance of this generator class has to be constructed with the following parameters: ``model`` must
    be a (machine learning) model which implements the ``PredictGraphMixin`` and which predicts the
    property of the graphs in question. ``processing`` must be an instance of ``ProcessingBase``, which
    can process the domain specific representations of a graph (most of the time a string representation)
    into a GraphDict and a visualization image. In that regard it is important that the correct processing
    instance is used which is compatible with the used predictor model. ``distance_func`` should be a
    callable function that determines the distance between two predictions of the model. The counterfactual
    generation will try to maximize that measure of distance. ``neighborhood_func`` has to be a function
    which receives the domain specific representation of an original graph and then returns the entire
    1-edit neighborhood of that graph, which is legible to be a counterfactual.

    :param model: A machine learning model which implements the PredictGraphMixin
    :param processing: An instance of BaseProcessing, which can transform a domain specific
        graph representation into a valid GraphDict for the model to make its prediction from.
    :param neighborhood_func: A function which must accept a single positional parameter which is the
        domain specific representation of a single graph. It should return a list of domain specific
        representations of valid graphs which represent the entire 1-edit neighborhood of the original.
    :param distance_func: A function which must accept two arguments: The original prediction and the
        prediction of a counterfactual. It should return a single numeric value indicating the prediction
        distance between the two elements. This distance measure will be used as the basis for the
        counterfactual choice.
